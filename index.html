      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div id="about">
      <p>My name is Sonia Habamba. I am currently a student at Moringa school. I have had a thing for working with computers ever since I was young. My parents used to own a cyber cafe and that's where I learnt the basics of using  computers.I I decided to become a programmer because I love creating and I enjoy solving problems. I feel like programming will allow me to create something out of nothing and also I'm not limited to physical constraints. With enough effort I can imagine and create. Programming will let me create things that will tie into the rest of my life whether for fun, productivity or profit.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I am a very introverted person so when it comes to hobbies I have quite a lot since am always in my own space, I guess. Here is a list of a few of my hobbies.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading: articles, novels, blogs, you name it</li>
        <li>Listening to music and podcasts. I don't just listen to music passively, I delve into it.</li>
        <li>Watching movies and tv shows.</li>
      </ul>
